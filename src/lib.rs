//! This crate provides a streaming CSV (comma separated values) writer and
//! reader that works with the `serialize` crate to do type based encoding
//! and decoding. There are two primary goals of this project:
//!
//! 1. The default mode of parsing should *just work*. This means the parser
//!    will bias toward providing *a* parse over a *correct* parse (with
//!    respect to RFC 4180).
//! 2. Convenient to use by default, but when performance is needed, the
//!    API will provide an escape hatch.
//!
//! ## Simple example
//!
//! This shows how you can decode records into Rust types. This saves a ton
//! of boiler plate, e.g., converting strings to numeric types.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let data = "
//! sticker,mortals,7
//! bribed,personae,7
//! wobbling,poncing,4
//! interposed,emmett,9
//! chocolate,refile,7";
//!
//! let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_string(data).has_headers(false);
//! for row in rdr.decode() {
//!     let (n1, n2, dist): (String, String, uint) = row.unwrap();
//!     println!("{}, {}: {}", n1, n2, dist);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you just want a `Vec` of all the records, then you can use the
//! `collect` method defined on iterators:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let data = "
//! sticker,mortals,7
//! bribed,personae,7
//! wobbling,poncing,4
//! interposed,emmett,9
//! chocolate,refile,7";
//!
//! type Row = (String, String, uint);
//!
//! let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_string(data).has_headers(false);
//! let rows = rdr.decode().collect::<Result<Vec<Row>, _>>().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(rows.len(), 5);
//! ```
//!
//! Please see the `Reader` type for more documentation and examples.
//!
//! ## Iteratoring over records
//!
//! This crate exposes **4** distinct ways of iterating over CSV records. In
//! the majority of use cases, you should use the `decode` method as shown
//! above because it is the most convenient. But other types of iterators are
//! exposed for when you need them.
//!
//! The iterators listed below are presented in order of performance. The first
//! (type based decoding) is the slowest and the last (zero allocation) is the
//! fastest. There is clear evidence of this claim in the benchmarks. (Just
//! run `cargo bench`.)
//!
//! ### Decoded records
//!
//! As shown above. This uses type based decoding on each record.
//!
//! ### String records
//!
//! Yields each record as a `Vec<String>`. Namely, this assumes that all CSV
//! data is UTF-8 encoded. This is the standard CSV interface that you've
//! probably come to expect from using other CSV parsers.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let data = "
//! sticker,mortals,7
//! bribed,personae,7
//! wobbling,poncing,4
//! interposed,emmett,9
//! chocolate,refile,7";
//!
//! let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_string(data).has_headers(false);
//! for row in rdr.records() {
//!     let row = row.unwrap();
//!     println!("{}", row);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Byte string records
//!
//! Yields each record as a `Vec<ByteString>`. Namely, this allows reading CSV
//! data that is not UTF-8 encoded (or improperly encoded!).
//!
//! ```rust
//! let data = b"
//! sti\xffcker,mortals,7
//! chocolate,refile,7";
//!
//! let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_bytes(data).has_headers(false);
//! for row in rdr.byte_records() {
//!     let row = row.unwrap();
//!     println!("{}", row);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Byte slice records
//!
//! This iterator is defined on the `Reader` type itself and yields *fields*
//! instead of records (unlike the other iterators). Each field is a `&[u8]`.
//! No allocation is performed during parsing (unlike the other iterators,
//! which at least allocate a `Vec<u8>` for each field and a `Vec<_>` for each
//! record). Since no allocation is performed, this "iterator" doesn't actually
//! implement the `Iterator` trait (since it cannot be done safely).
//!
//! This is the lowest level interface and should only be used when you need
//! the performance.
//!
//! ```rust
//! let data = "
//! sticker,mortals,7
//! bribed,personae,7
//! wobbling,poncing,4
//! interposed,emmett,9
//! chocolate,refile,7";
//!
//! let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_string(data);
//! while !rdr.done() {
//!     while let Some(r) = rdr.next_field().into_iter_result() {
//!         print!("{} ", r.unwrap());
//!     }
//!     println!("");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There is more explanation for how this iterator interface works on the
//! `Reader` type.
//!
//! ## Compliance with RFC 4180
//!
//! [RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) seems to the closest thing
//! to an official specification for CSV.
//! Currently, the parser in this crate will read a strict superset of
//! RFC 4180 while the writer will always write CSV data that conforms to
//! RFC 4180. This approach was taken because CSV data is commonly malformed
//! and there is nothing worse than trying to read busted CSV data with a
//! library that says it can't do it.
//!
//! With that said, a "strict" mode may be added that will only read CSV data
//! that conforms to RFC 4180.
//!
//! Here are a few notes on compatibility with RFC 4180:
//!
//!   * Both CRLF and LF line endings are supported. This is seamless in the
//!     parser. By default, the encoder uses LF line endings but can be
//!     instructed to use CRLF with the `crlf` method.
//!   * The first record is read as a "header" by default, but this can be
//!     disabled by calling `no_headers` before reading any records.
//!     (N.B. The encoder has no explicit support for headers. Simply encode a
//!     vector of strings instead.)
//!   * By default, the delimiter is a comma, but it can be changed to any
//!     **ASCII** byte character with the `delimiter` method (for either
//!     writing or reading).
//!   * The decoder interprets `\"` as an escaped quote in addition to the
//!     standard `""`.
//!   * By default, both the writer and reader will enforce the invariant
//!     that all records are the same length. (This is what RFC 4180 demands.)
//!     If a record with a different length is found, an error is returned.
//!     This behavior may be turned off by calling `flexible` with `true`.
//!   * Empty lines (that do not include other whitespace) are ignored
//!     by the parser.
//!   * This crates parses CSV data at the *byte* level, which means all
//!     delimiter and quote characters must be ASCII. While unfortunate, this
//!     means that CSV data that is not UTF-8 encoded can be parsed. In
//!     general, the writer and reader API biases toward using Unicode strings
//!     while providing an outlet to use byte strings.
