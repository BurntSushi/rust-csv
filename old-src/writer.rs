/// A CSV writer.
///
/// This writer provides a convenient interface for encoding CSV data. While
/// creating CSV data is much easier than parsing it, having a writer can
/// be convenient because it can handle quoting for you automatically.
/// Moreover, this particular writer supports `Encodable` types, which makes
/// it easy to write your custom types as CSV records.
///
/// All CSV data produced by this writer, with default options, conforms with
/// [RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180). (If certain options like
/// flexible record lengths are enabled, then compliance with RFC 4180 cannot
/// be guaranteed.)
///
/// One slight deviation is that records with a single empty field are always
/// encoded as `""`. This ensures that the record is not skipped since some
/// CSV parsers will ignore consecutive record terminators (like the one in
/// this crate).
///
/// ### Example
///
/// Here's an example that encodes word pairs and their edit distances:
///
/// ```rust
/// let records = vec![
///     ("sticker", "mortals", 7),
///     ("bribed", "personae", 7),
///     ("wobbling", "poncing", 4),
///     ("interposed", "emmett", 9),
///     ("chocolate", "refile", 7),
/// ];
///
/// let mut wtr = csv::Writer::from_memory();
/// for record in records.into_iter() {
///     let result = wtr.encode(record);
///     assert!(result.is_ok());
